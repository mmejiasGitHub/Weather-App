Developed a dynamic web application that provides real-time weather data for any city worldwide. 
This weather app fetches data from an API and display weather information. You can look up any City and get the weather.

## How it works:
> Search engine is very flexible. 
- To make it more precise put the city's name, comma, 2-letter country code (ISO3166). 
You will get all proper cities in chosen country.

## The order is important: 
- The first is city name then comma then country. 
- Example - San Juan, PR or New York, US.
